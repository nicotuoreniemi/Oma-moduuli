#Progress in the project

So, for my project there is a fictional small company that has a problem managing all of their computers. In my project, I'm going to solve that using Salt. Every computer will be managed from a master computer using Salt-states. The computers will be set up with company decided default programs and configurations. This way the set up will be near automatic and done with one command. 

Since it's a fictional problem, I'm going to simulate a small company myself using virtual machines with vagrant. I'll start the whole thing with an empty virtual Linux.

First of all I'm going to make everything manually and test that everything works. After that I'm going start with the automation of it. So for now, I've got a fresh Debian and I'll start with installing everything thats needed and configuring the programs. 

I'll continue to report on the progress of the project when I get more of a start with it.
