###Progress in the project

So, for my project there is a fictional small company that has a problem managing all of their computers. In my project, I'm going to solve that using Salt. Every computer will be managed from a master computer using Salt-states. The computers will be set up with company decided default programs and configurations. This way the set up will be near automatic and done with one command. 

Since it's a fictional problem, I'm going to simulate a small company myself using virtual machines. I'll start the whole thing with an empty virtual Linux.

I'll continue to report on the progress of the project when I get more of a start with it.
